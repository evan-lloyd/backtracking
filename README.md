# Backtracking
My code for a portion of my group's experiments run during SPAR Spring 2025. Read more about the experiments here: https://typst.app/project/r9kSBJZBZDI9nX2HjCrdl3

# Usage
You will need the Python package manager [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv). You can then install the required dependencies with `uv sync`. See [demo.ipynb](backtracking/demo.ipynb) for usage and experiments.
